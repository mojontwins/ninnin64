'' Subtileset generator

'' MK1_NES 0.1 introduced the concept of "simple tilesetmaps" where
'' 16 metatiles metatilesets were made seelcting 16 metatiles from the
'' full 48 global metatileset. Metatiles were still not pattern
'' mapped, in the sense that metatile N was still made of patterns
'' 64+N*4 and the next three patterns.

'' This tools takes the full 48 metatiles global metatileset and a 
'' list of 16 numbers to generate a new partial, "submetatileset"
